# IC-PBL Vending Machine Team Project

## Overview
This is a Python-based vending machine simulation project created for the IC PBL team project at Hanyang University (ERICA). The project was developed by the PBL team, with coding and design led by **Li Vladislav Alekseevich**.

The goal of this project is to simulate a vending machine's operation, including item selection, payment handling, and inventory tracking, with a graphical interface powered by **Pygame**.

## Features
- Interactive UI using `pygame`
- Item selection and purchasing system
- Basic inventory and product storage logic
- Simulated coin insertion/payment
- Modular code design (`Brain.py`, `Product_Storage.py`, `main.py`)

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pygame** (for UI and event handling)

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
